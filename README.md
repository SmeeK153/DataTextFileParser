# FlatFileParser

*This project is still under construction.*

The FlatFileParser Library provides an API for creating flat file data structures and managing those their instances independently. The structure can be used to read and edit existing flat files, as well as, serve as a guide for creating new flat files, all through the provided JavaFX GUI built-in. This library allows for quick plug-n-play style use to allow the implementation of flat files into a project with minimal time spent on actually implementing the library itself. It is designed to operate as-is and not require additional input other than creating and using the structures to read and write flat files.
